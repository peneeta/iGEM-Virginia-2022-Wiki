    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Here you will find all the protocols and experiments we ran over the course of our project. Below is a lab notebook organized by week, which includes labeled images of our gels and cultures. For further information about our protocols, click on <span class="bold-text">Detailed Workflow</span>. This includes every protocol and reagent we used in our study with instructions on what we did. To see our lab schedules by month, click on <span class="bold-text">Lab Calendars</span>. 
    <br>
    Our goal is to ensure that our experiments are reproducible by other researchers or iGEM teams, so please do not hesitate to reach out to our team if you have any questions about reagents or methods!</p>
