      <h2>University of Rochester 2022</h2>
      <hr>
      <p> (Very rough draft of what to say.  I'll fix this up when we extablish what our collaboration with them will be or if this is just a one time meeting).  Our team met with the URoch 2022 iGEM team to share ideas and discuss potential collaborations.  URoch 2022's project involves the production of a protein that could bind to any antibody, so we discussed the common ground of working with antibodies.</p>

Our team had the opportunity to meet with the iGEM Vilnius 2020 Team Captain for advice on how to design lateral flow assays and feedback on what we could be doing to better engage stakeholders with our design. </p>
