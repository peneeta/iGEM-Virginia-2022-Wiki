            <h2>University of Rochester 2022</h2>
            <p> In our meeting with the University of Rochester iGEM team, we learned about each other’s projects and gave feedback to each other. We learned that we are both using the E. coli SHuffle strain to produce antibodies. It was fascinating to see how both teams were using a similar process to produce antibodies but for completely different fields of study. We also exchanged ideas for human practices and invited each other to participate in our respective HP journeys in order to stay in touch.</p>

     <h2>Vilnius 2020</h2>
    <p> We met with the Vilnius 2020 iGEM team lead Ieva Lingyte to discuss their project, Flavoflow. Flavoflow constructed a lateral flow assay (LFA) to detect a type of bacteria infection in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS). Since we had decided to build a lateral flow assay to detect atherosclerosis, we decided to reach out for advice on how to build our assay. Ms. Lingyte provided us with crucial information about integrated human practices (IHP) and LFA equipment. In terms of IHP, she drove us through how each human practices (HP) activity they did impacted the design of their solution. She emphasized the importance of talking to the major stakeholders who are directly involved in the process of consumerization of the device. She also encouraged us to direct each outreach activity to a different age group. This directly affected how we conducted our IHP/outreach events –by valuing the major stakeholders’ feedback and targeting each education and outreach activity to a different age audience while not losing the message of our project. Next, we talked about the LFA design. Ms. Lingyte referred us to instruments and resources that helped her team out in making a neat and accurate test strip. She referred us to the BioDot Airjet instrument to create a neat assembly as well as Micromolds, a company that creates templates for assays such as LFAs. </p>

    <h4>How did Ms. Lingyte influence the design of our project? </h4>
    <p>Initially, our project was centered around detection of biomarkers to assess for risk of atherosclerosis. However, after speaking with Ms. Lingyte and other experts, we began to construct a second prong to our project centered around prevention/impedance of further development of atherosclerosis. This is where our cookbook and healthy lifestyle app come into play. Ms. Lingyte explained to us that it is not enough just to detect, but rather it is important to provide the next steps once atherosclerosis is detected.</p>

      <h2>Midsummer Meetup</h2>
      <p>On August 13th, the University of Maryland hosted a mid-Atlantic day-long conference attended by the University of Virginia, William and Mary, Johns Hopkins University, and East Coast Biocrew. Each school gave a brief presentation covering their progress and goals for this year's competition. It was a great opportunity to engage with other iGEMers, receive feedback on our own project, and clarify how we could best present our materials to communicate with larger audiences.</p>
