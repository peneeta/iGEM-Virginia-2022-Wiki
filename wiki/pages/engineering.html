            <h2>The Engineering Design Cycle</h2>
            <p>Throughout the course of our project, we faced many challenges and setbacks we needed to overcome. We also talked to stakeholders and researchers to gain knowledge we otherwise would not have had. These warranted repeated changes to our design and tweaks to aspects of our project. Below, we show our iterations through the engineering design cycle, both due to integrated human practices and experimental discoveries.</p>

            <h2>Cycle 1: IK17 scFv</h2>
            <div class="cyc">
              <p>Design</p>
              <p>Our design is based around producing three different antibodies for our test strip: the first to bind to oxLDL, the second to bind to oxLDL on a different location than the first to form a sandwich complex, and a third to bind to our first antibody as a control. In order to increase efficiency and simplicity we decided to produce our second antibody as just the scFv fragment that detects our biomarker. Through extensive research we chose the IK17 antibody, known to bind to oxLDL, as our scFv (see Design page)</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cyc">
              <p>Build</p>
              <p>In order for IK17 to work as our scFv, we needed it to bind to a different epitope on oxLDL than our first antibody (orticumab). So we used AlphaFold to produce 3D structures of the IK17 scFv, orticumab, and the ApoB protein on oxLDL.

            </div>

            <div class="cyc">
              <p>Test</p>
              <p>We then used several protein docking softwares to test if our scFv bound ApoB at a different location than orticumab, but none of the docking softwares we tried had the capability to predict the specific binding sites of our proteins.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cyc">
              <p>Learn</p>
              <p>After meeting with Dr. Norbert Leitinger, a professor in the UVA Department of Pharmacology (see IHP), we learned what kind of antibodies are being used today in the field of oxidized phospholipids. He recommended that we use the E06 antibody that binds to the oxidized phospholipids on oxLDL rather than the ApoB protein.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="cyc">
              <p>Conclusion</p>
              <p>We decided to use the scFv of the McPC603 antibody, an antibody similar to E06 that also binds to oxidized phospholipids, in addition to IK17 to serve as our immobilized antibody at the test line. Having two antibodies that bind to different epitopes on oxLDL increases the chance of oxLDL binding to the test line and signal detection: specifically, having one antibody bind to the ApoB protein and one bind to the oxidized phospholipids on oxLDL provides the greatest variability in forming a sandwich complex with the first antibody. This confers significant advantage in the detection of oxLDL, offering both specificity and reducing the false positive rates of detecting other potential biomolecules that may have only either MDA-modified-apoB or OxPL.</p>

              <h4>Cycle 1</h4>
              <p>Design</p>
              <p>
                By reading peer-journal articles, we designed our device to use antibodies produced by the E. coli SHuffle strain and designed the construct of our antibody gene sequence. We designed four plasmids all using the same vector, pSB3K3, and one gene fragment each encoding one of our antibodies or antibody fragments.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="cyc">
              <p>
                Build:
                Since the assembly of our functional plasmids only involved inserting one gene fragment into a vector, we decided to proceed with traditional cloning (TC) the fragments into E. coli DH5-alpha cells. At first, we followed the standard TC protocol - digesting DNA fragments with restriction enzymes, separating the fragments through gel electrophoresis, ligating the fragments extracted from the gel, and transforming the cells with the ligated products.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="cyc">
              <p>Learn:
                Our transformation had very low yields as few positive colonies were observed to grow, so we decided to look towards other cloning methods for increasing the transformation efficiency and yield.
              </p>

              <h4>Cycle 2</h4>
              <p>Design</p>
              <p>We decided to design a modified version of traditional cloning by mixing the digested insert and vector directly in a tube for ligation without performing gel electrophoresis. Here arises the possibility that the original gene fragment cut out from the vector will re-ligate back into the vector. However, since our undigested vector, pSB3K3, contains a mRFP gene that will be cut out through digestion, transformed cells containing the original mRFP gene instead of the insert will be red, and white colonies on the kanamycin plates should be transformed cells containing our gene of interest.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="cyc">
              <p>Build</p>
              <p>Using our new modified traditional cloning, we cloned our antibody sequences into DH5-alpha cells. After transforming, both red and white colonies appeared as we expected, so we only selected the white colonies that were predicted to contain our gene of interest. Both restriction mapping and sequencing our transformed products verified that the DH5-alpha cells contained our antibody sequences in the pSB3K3 vector. Since our products were verified, we then cloned the plasmid into the E. coli SHuffle strain for protein production. Restriction mapping and sequencing verified SHuffle contained the correct construct.

            </div>
            <div class="cyc">
              <p>Test</p>
              <p>We induced SHuffle cells to produce our antibodies. Protein bands at the correct molecular weight were observed on SDS-PAGE gels, however, the expression level of protein was rather low. 
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="cyc">
              <p>Learn</p>
              <p>We learned through academic articles and experts that change in the times of induction and the temperature can influence protein yields, and we modified these parameters in our next iteration.</p>

          <h2>Future Iterations</h2>
          <p>If changing these variables does not increase our protein yields, we will redesign our BioBrick construct. We will switch the pSB3K3 vector we are currently using into the standard pET vector used for protein expression, design our RBS to have maximum translational efficiency rather than 75% efficiency, and use Robinson promoters to increase protein expression. </p>
