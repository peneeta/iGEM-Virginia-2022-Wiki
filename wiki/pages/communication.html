        <h2>Communication and Spreading Awareness</h2>
        <p>The gap between science and the public must be narrowed if technological developments can truly serve society. While the goal of our project was to create a product that can be used by high-risk patients, we understand that other methods of prevention exist and a true solution must be multi-faceted. Therefore, major efforts went into communicating awareness of this projectâ€™s problem and our research.</p>

            <h2>Podcast</h2>
            <p>One of the major issues with atherosclerosis and heart disease is the lack of clarity on the severity of these diseases and how one can prevent them. In order to emphasize prevention-based healthcare as a solution to the rising deaths from cardiovascular disease, our team created a podcast to explain the development, risk factors, current treatments, and prevention methods. Each episode has us interviewing an expert who works with atherosclerosis, and focuses on a specific topic. To keep the podcast engaging, we themed the podcast with a true-crime narrative. Our podcast is released on Spotify Podcasts and Google Podcasts.</p>

            <h2>Meetups</h2>
            <p>
              Through this summer and fall, our team had presented at two different conferences: Mid-Atlantic Meetup hosted by University of Maryland and University of Virginia's Summer Research Symposium. Public presentations are important to our team because they require us to formally present scientific information in an engaging way. 
              <br>
              The Mid-Atlantic meeting allowed us to communicate our project to other iGEM teams and learn about theirs. These types of meetings are important since the premise of iGEM allows us to understand the processes of these projects and only focus on exploring the synthetic biology aspect. At the meetup, five iGEM teams presented and learnt from each other. Our presentation allowed us to educate our peers about atherosclerosis and the importance of cardiovascular health. Through mutual interests in synthetic biology, we fostered a community and established contacts for further opportunities. More information on the Mid-Atlantic Meetup is explained on the collaborations page.

            <h4>UVA Summer Research Symposium</h4>
            <p>The University of Virginia's Summer Research Symposium was a research exhibition for our peers and graduate students. Our team presented a poster about our project and the synthetic biology behind it. As we interacted with other researchers, we explained the importance of atherosclerosis and the relevance of synthetic biology. We explained how atherosclerosis development is heavily dependent on the habits we make in our early years. Therefore, it is critical that we build heart healthy habits as college students to create a lifelong commitment to heart health. We raised awareness about our project and synthetic biology at our university because it is important that we get feedback from peers in research-based communities. </p>

            <h2>App</h2>
            <p>
              To use the information gained from our human practices efforts, we created an app demo that can be later extended into a fully released app, which will promote awareness on atherosclerosis. The app demo and further details can be found on the <a href="{{ url_for('pages', page='implementation') }}">implementation page</a>. 
              <br>
              <br>
              This app allows us to interact with the general public by providing resources for them to decrease their risk factors, such as heart-healthy recipes in a cookbook and locating physicians and nutritionists in their area so they can seek guidance for their cardiovascular health. General information on the regular risk factors, detection methods, and current treatments were also explained in the app, influenced by interviews we conducted from the podcast.

            <h2>Blog</h2>
            <p>Part of our collaboration with the Pune IISER 2 team included the creation of a blog on Wix.  Our Letâ€™s Science blog was created as a resource targeting high school students with the ultimate goal of raising awareness and excitement for the field of synthetic biology. As high school students interested in STEM, we often encountered scientific terms of which we would not know the definition. Our Letâ€™s Science blog article aims to explain synthetic biology techniques while defining many common synthetic biology terms to encourage high school students to foster their interest in science. Our Letâ€™s Science posts cover atherosclerosis, neglected tropical diseases (NGTs) with a focus on Dengue (IISER Pune IIâ€™s target disease), recent synthetic biology developments, information on the iGEM community, and creative projects that have come out of the competition. We tie this into our project as a synthetic biology educational tool in the context of our projects. We recognize that science is a community and therefore, we plan to create a feedback and discussion forum on the blog site for students to communicate with us and each other about these blogs.
