        <p> <span class="bold-text">Coronary artery disease (CAD) occurs when the arteries cannot deliver enough oxygen-rich blood to the heart.</span> It is the most common type of heart disease, and has varying severity depending on the type. CADs begin as atherosclerosis, or cholesterol buildup in the artery walls which forms plaque. Over time, the buildup can block blood flow in the large arteries. CAD is “silent” in most cases, meaning that the first sign of illness is a heart attack or stroke. Treatment involves lifestyle changes such as managing stress, eating heart-healthy foods, and being physically active. After a cardiac event, patients are given statins to lower cholesterol or aspirin to lower the chance of a blood clot. </p>

      <div class="text-wrapper pb-4 mb-3">
        <p>
          Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the large arteries that is the main cause of coronary artery disease complications. It is characterized by plaque buildup within the inner arterial walls. Half of all deaths in the Western hemisphere and more than 15 million deaths in the world are attributed to this disease [1, 2]. Underlying conditions such as hyperlipidemia (high lipid concentration in the blood), smoking, and diabetes cause damage to the inner arterial walls, activating the body’s inflammatory response.

          <h4 class="pb-3 mb-3 select-header">Pathogenesis</h4>
          <p>
            Atherosclerotic lesions initiate with endothelial cell damage, which allows low density lipoproteins (LDL) into the intima, or the inner vessel space[3]. LDL is very prone to oxidation, and the oxidized-LDL particles (oxLDL) are toxic and cause inflammation, which activates the body’s immune response [4, 5]. 

            Monocytes, commonly known as white blood cells, are attracted to the lesion. The monocytes migrate into the intima under the influence of chemokines [6]. As monocytes enter the intima, they differentiate into macrophages and engulf oxLDL. Macrophages uptake OxLDL to the point of saturation, becoming foam cells. The foam cells undergo apoptosis and release lipid necrotic cores [7]. 

            A fibrous cap of collagen and elastin, produced by smooth muscle cells (SMCs), forms over the necrotic core, attempting to heal the lesion [8]. Lesions with a thin cap are more likely to rupture and thus less stable, leading to blockage in the blood vessel [9]. After rupture a thrombus, or blood clot, forms. Chemokines play an important role in platelets activation and aggregation, ultimately causing a heart attack or stroke [10].

      <div class="text-wrapper d-flex flex-column align-items-center pb-5 mb-3">
        <p>
          Those living with atherosclerosis often do not have any physical symptoms until the plaque build-up is so significant that organs and tissues lack oxygen. The symptom most commonly reported is angina, which is chest pain caused by ischaemia, characterized by the lack of blood supply in the heart10. Diagnostics for these symptomatic patients, however, pose problems in terms of cost and effectiveness, and often require numerous doctor’s visits and extensive testing before a diagnosis is provided.

        <div class="text-wrapper pb-4 mb-3">
          <p>
            To combat these problems, we developed a lateral flow assay (LFA) to test for early atherosclerosis. An LFA is a cost-effective test constructed to produce results promptly without a doctor’s visit. Typically, LFAs are a diagnostic method for pathogens, diseases, and other lingering health problems. They detect biomarkers of diseases present in a liquid sample that is dropped on one end of the strip. The strip shows vertical lines after completion of the test, with one line indicating a negative test and two lines indicating a positive result. Getting results happens within a matter of five to thirty minutes, and LFAs can be rapidly produced for widespread accessibility.

            Most LFAs use antibodies conjugated with gold nanoparticles for visual detection of certain biomarkers of a disease in the provided sample. After the test is complete, two lines depict a positive test whilst one line depicts a negative test. The assay completes within a matter of five to thirty minutes and can be rapidly produced.

          <div class="text-wrapper">
            <p>
              Our test uses antibodies to detect OxLDL in a blood sample. OxLDL has been cited in the literature as a hallmark biomarker of early atherosclerosis. It is a lipoprotein, meaning it has a protein with a lipid shell. In order to detect this biomarker, we designed antibodies with known epitopes on both the lipid portion and protein portion of OxLDL. More about our specific design is available on our design page.

          <div class="text-wrapper pb-4 mb-3">
            <p>
              Synthetic biology plays an impertinent role in the development of our solution. Traditional antibody production requires inoculating animals with antigens through an invasive process. First, the animal is selected and bred, then antibodies are collected by isolating antibody-producing B-cells to create hybridoma cells. This process creates great pain and distress for the animal and stands in a moral gray area. It is also extremely time-consuming and costly. 
              The specially genetically-engineered strain <span class='italic-text'>E. coli</span> SHuffle circumvents these concerns. SHuffle allows antibodies to be produced in the simplest biology laboratory, completely avoiding any animal harm. It is very cost-friendly, has a shorter generation period, and easily modifiable antibody sequences.</p>

        <div class="text-wrapper pb-5 mb-3">
          <p> 
            Knowing that cardiovascular disease affects so many people worldwide, our team wanted to design an inexpensive screening test that would result in a more direct path to diagnosis, thus lowering the cost of testing overall, as well as lowering the mortality rate of cardiovascular disease with preventative measures. Both the lack of symptoms that are associated with plaque formation and the need for accessibility are points we focused on in the development of this lateral flow assay. 
            <br>
            At least 200,000 of the deaths caused by heart disease each year are preventable with changes in health habits, such as diet, and help from proper healthcare. Proper diet and healthcare, however, are not accessible options for all of the population. Nearly 43% of the world population, accounting for around 3 billion people, is unable to afford healthy eating. As of 2021, 9.6% of the United States population did not have healthcare, which translates to 31.1 million people. Although risk factors for atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease can be detected in yearly medical check-ups, doctor’s visits for the US individuals included in these statistics are not feasible options. Especially when asymptomatic, risk factors tend to go undetected until it is too late. 
            <br>
            Even those who have healthcare and are able to proceed with diagnostic testing are presented with problems surrounding cost. The path to diagnosis is already expensive, as numerous tests, with a high threshold for detection, are required before a diagnosis is confidently provided. Healthcare, however, is becoming increasingly complex as deductibles, copays, and coinsurance become higher. Annually, families of a member with atherosclerosis are paying over $20,000, with over $2,000 being paid out of pocket, or 16% of their household income. Around 3.9 families reported a large difficulty in paying for these bills, and 1.6 million families were unable. 
            While many organizations stress the importance of healthy habits and going to the doctor, and these are important, our team wanted to spread accessibility to preventive testing so that these doctor’s visits are not a requirement.
