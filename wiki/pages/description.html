          <h2>Abstract</h2>
          <p>Over 27.6% of the global population suffers from atherosclerosis, a plaque buildup in arteries that causes acute dangerous events like heart attack and stroke after lying dormant for years. <span class="bold-text">Despite high prevalence, current detection methods are costly, time-consuming, and unused during medical visits unless individuals present signs of cardiovascular complications, at which point atherosclerosis is largely irreversible.</span> We describe a method of early, accessible atherosclerosis detection: a lateral flow assay test strip that detects oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), a biomarker correlated with early and middle stages of atherosclerosis. Our device provides a rapid, proactive, point-of-care approach to evaluating atherosclerosis risk, allowing early treatment and potential reversal of disease. We employ SHuffle <span class="italic-text">E. coli</span> to produce anti-oxLDL antibodies that integrate into easy-to-read test strips to detect the presence of oxLDL in blood. Our device will provide a sorely-needed low-cost, early detection method for atherosclerosis, improving healthcare globally, especially for under-resourced communities.</p>

        <div class="text-wrapper">
          <p> 
            <span class="bold-text">Coronary heart disease (CAD)</span> occurs when the arteries cannot deliver enough oxygen-rich blood to the heart. It is the most common type of heart disease, and has varying causes depending on the type. The root cause of CAD is atherosclerosis, or cholesterol buildup in the artery walls leading to plaque formation. Over time, this plaque can block blood flow in the large arteries. CAD is “silent” in most cases, meaning the first sign of illness is extreme, indicating a heart attack or stroke. 
            Treatment, if detected early, involves lifestyle changes such as managing stress, eating heart-healthy foods, and being physically active. After a cardiac event, patients are given statins to lower cholesterol or aspirin to lower the chance of a blood clot. 
            Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the large arteries that is the main cause of coronary artery disease complications. It is characterized by plaque buildup within the inner arterial walls. </p>

          <h4>Pathogenesis</h4>
          <p>
            Atherosclerotic lesions begin with endothelial cell damage, allowing low density lipoproteins (LDL) to enter the intima, also known as the inner vessel space [3]. LDL is very prone to oxidation, and  oxidized-LDL particles (oxLDL) are toxic and cause inflammation, which then activates the body’s immune response. 

            Monocytes, commonly known as white blood cells, are attracted to the lesion and migrate into the intima under the influence of chemokines. As monocytes enter the intima, they differentiate into macrophages and engulf oxLDL. Macrophages uptake oxLDL to the point of saturation, becoming foam cells. The foam cells undergo apoptosis and release lipid necrotic cores. 

            A fibrous cap of collagen and elastin, produced by smooth muscle cells (SMCs), forms over the necrotic core, attempting to heal the lesion. Lesions with a thin cap are more likely to rupture and thus less stable, leading to blockage in the blood vessel. After rupture, a thrombus, or blood clot, forms, ultimately leading to fatal heart attacks and strokes.

        <h4>Problems with Current Diagnosis Methods</h4>
        <div class="text-wrapper d-flex flex-column align-items-center">
          <p>
            Those living with atherosclerosis often do not have any physical symptoms until the plaque build-up is so significant that organs and tissues lack oxygen. The symptom most commonly reported is angina, which is chest pain caused by ischaemia, characterized by the lack of blood supply in the heart10. Diagnostics for these symptomatic patients, however, pose problems in terms of cost and effectiveness, and often require numerous doctor’s visits and extensive testing before a diagnosis is provided.

          <h2>Our Solution</h2>
          <div class="text-wrapper">
            <p>
              To combat these problems, we developed a method of early and accessible atherosclerosis detection: an easy-to-read test strip that detects oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) based on a lateral flow assay (LFA). Our device provides a rapid, proactive, and point-of-care approach to evaluating atherosclerosis risk, allowing early treatment and potential reversal of disease. This method will significantly reduce the cost of current detection methods and provide a method of early atherosclerosis detection, improving healthcare globally, especially for underserved communities.
              <br>
              An LFA is a low-cost, convenient, and portable test constructed to produce results promptly without a doctor’s visit. Typically, LFAs are a diagnostic method for pathogens, diseases, and other lingering health problems. They detect biomarkers of diseases present in a liquid sample that is deposited on one end of the strip. The strip shows vertical lines after completion of the test, with one line indicating a negative test and two lines indicating a positive result. Getting results happens within a matter of five to thirty minutes, and LFAs can be rapidly produced for widespread accessibility. More about our specific design is available on our design page.

                <h4>OxLDL as a Biomarker</h4>
                <p>
                  Our test uses antibodies to detect oxLDL in a blood sample. oxLDL has been cited in the literature as a key factor in the development of early onset atherosclerosis. Every individual has a baseline concentration of oxLDL in their bloodstream, but in patients with atherosclerosis, oxLDL levels are elevated. It is a lipoprotein, which means it has a protein that is encompassed with a lipid shell. The structure of oxLDL is not well-characterized, which is why current assays utilizing oxLDL are not in development. In order to detect this biomarker, we designed antibodies that recognize known epitopes on both the lipid portion and protein portion of oxLDL to detect it from different angles. These regions will be used to bind to oxLDL for simplest detection. More about our specific design is available on our design page.

            <h4>Why Synthetic Biology?</h4>
            <div class="text-wrapper">
              <p>
                Synthetic biology plays an impertinent role in the development of our solution. Traditional antibody production requires inoculating animals with antigens through an invasive process. The animal is selected, bred, then antibodies are collected by isolating antibody-producing B-cells to create hybridoma cells. This process creates great pain and distress for the animal and stands in a moral gray area. It is also extremely time-consuming and costly. 
                <br>
                The specially genetically-engineered strain <span class="italic-text">E. coli</span> SHuffle circumvents these concerns. SHuffle allows antibodies to be produced in the simplest biology laboratory, completely avoiding any animal harm. It is cost-friendly, has a shorter generation period due to rapid bacterial proliferation, and utilizes easily-modifiable BioBricks to synthesize antibody sequences.
                <br> 
                In addition to these benefits, synthetic biology also allows us to combine existing antibody sequences to construct new ones better optimized for production and specificity for our biomarker of interest. Through the open source community of synthetic biology and knowledge of the inner workings of antibodies, we have been able to design and produce these proteins. </p>

          <h2>Inspiration Behind Our Project</h2>
          <div class="text-wrapper">
            <p> 
              Knowing that cardiovascular disease is preventable, yet affects so many people worldwide, our team wanted to design an inexpensive screening test that would result in a more direct path to diagnosis, and thus utilize this preventability. We began our research by looking more into why symptoms were silent, then focused on how to alleviate the consequences of this while simultaneously increasing accessibility. 
              <br>
	            Although 200,000 of the deaths caused by heart disease each year are preventable with changes in health habits, such as diet, and help from proper healthcare, we have learned these needed changes are not always accessible. As of 2021, 9.6% of the United States population did not have healthcare, which translates to 31.1 million people. Atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease detection is possible in yearly medical check-ups, however, doctor’s visits for these individuals are not feasible options. The urgency of these issues is enhanced by the abundance of asymptomatic, risk factors commonly undetected until it is too late. 
              <br>
	            Even those who have healthcare and are able to proceed with diagnostic testing are presented with problems surrounding cost. As mentioned before, the path to diagnosis is already expensive, as numerous tests with a high threshold for detection are required before a diagnosis is confidently provided. Healthcare, however, is becoming increasingly complex as deductibles, copays, and coinsurance become higher. Around 3.9 million families, making up 45% of those with atherosclerosis, reported a large difficulty in paying for these bills, and 1.6 million families were unable. 
              <br>
	            While many organizations stress the importance of healthy habits and going to the doctor, as these are important, our team wanted to also spread accessibility to preventive testing so that these doctor’s visits and high costs are not a requirement for screening.

            <p>
              To further our project, our focus is to integrate these test results with healthcare providers by developing a helper app to help log results and develop a plan to improve health alongside doctors’ recommendations. Read more about our app design here.
              Another area of improvement is to increase antibody yields through optimizing <span class="italic-text">E. coli</span> SHuffle. This will enable more test strips to be produced at a faster rate, since more antibodies will be available for use. As a result, the cost of the strip will decrease, increasing its accessibility.
              While our test strip is predictive of atherosclerosis, we also want to improve its specificity for atherosclerosis by adding more antibodies that detect different biomarkers associated with atherosclerosis.  More information about our proposed implementation is available here.</p>
