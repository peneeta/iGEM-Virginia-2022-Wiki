          <h2>Abstract</h2>
          <p>Over 27.6% of the global population suffers from atherosclerosis, a plaque buildup in arteries that causes acute dangerous events like heart attack and stroke after lying dormant for years. <span class="bold-text">Despite high prevalence, current detection methods are costly, time-consuming, and unused during medical visits unless individuals present signs of cardiovascular complications, at which point atherosclerosis is largely irreversible.</span> We describe a method of early, accessible atherosclerosis detection: a lateral flow assay test strip that detects oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), a biomarker correlated with early and middle stages of atherosclerosis. Our device provides a rapid, proactive, point-of-care approach to evaluating atherosclerosis risk, allowing early treatment and potential reversal of disease. We employ SHuffle <span class="italic-text">E. coli</span> to produce anti-oxLDL antibodies that integrate into easy-to-read test strips to detect the presence of oxLDL in blood. Our device will provide a sorely-needed low-cost, early detection method for atherosclerosis, improving healthcare globally, especially for under-resourced communities.</p>

        <div class="text-wrapper">
          <p> 
            <span class="bold-text">Coronary heart disease (CAD) occurs when the arteries cannot deliver enough oxygen-rich blood to the heart.</span><sup>6</sup> It is the most common type of heart disease, and has varying causes depending on the type. The root cause of CAD is atherosclerosis, or cholesterol buildup in the artery walls leading to plaque formation. Over time, this plaque can block blood flow in the large arteries. <span class="bold-text">CAD is “silent”</span> in most cases, meaning the first sign of illness is extreme, indicating a heart attack or stroke.<sup>6</sup>
            <br> 
            <br>
            Treatment, if detected early, involves lifestyle changes such as managing stress, eating heart-healthy foods, and being physically active. After a cardiac event, patients are given statins to lower cholesterol or aspirin to lower the chance of a blood clot. 
            <span class="bold-text">Atherosclerosis</span> is a <span class="bold-text">chronic inflammatory disease</span> of the large arteries that is the main cause of coronary artery disease complications. It is characterized by <span class="bold-text">plaque buildup</span> within the inner arterial walls.<sup>7</sup></p>

          <h4>Pathogenesis</h4>
          <p>
            Atherosclerotic lesions begin with <span class="bold-text">endothelial cell damage,</span> allowing <span class="bold-text">low density lipoproteins (LDL)</span> to enter the <span class="bold-text">intima,</span> also known as the inner vessel space.<sup>8</sup> LDL is very prone to oxidation, and <span class="bold-text">oxidized-LDL particles (oxLDL)</span> are <span class="bold-text">toxic,</span> and cause <span class="bold-text">inflammation,</span> which then activates the body’s immune response.<sup>9,10</sup>
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="bold-text">Monocytes,</span> commonly known as <span class="bold-text">white blood cells,</span> are attracted to the lesion and migrate into the intima under the influence of <span class="bold-text">chemokines.</span><sup>11</sup> As monocytes enter the intima, they differentiate into <span class="bold-text">macrophages</span> and engulf oxLDL. Macrophages uptake oxLDL to the point of saturation, becoming <span class="bold-text">foam cells.</span> The foam cells undergo <span class="bold-text">apoptosis</span> and release <span class="bold-text">lipid necrotic cores.</span><sup>12</sup> 
            <br>
            <br>
            A <span class="bold-text">fibrous cap</span> of collagen and elastin, produced by <span class="bold-text">smooth muscle cells (SMCs),</span> forms over the necrotic core, attempting to heal the lesion.<sup>13</sup> Lesions with a thin cap are <span class="bold-text">more likely to rupture</span> and thus less stable, leading to blockage in the blood vessel. After rupture, a <span class="bold-text">thrombus,</span> or blood clot, forms, which can dislodge and cause a blockage restricting blood flow, ultimately leading to fatal heart attacks and strokes.<sup>14</sup>

              To combat these problems, we developed a method of <span class="bold-text">early and accessible atherosclerosis detection</span>: an <span class="bold-text">easy-to-read</span> test strip that detects oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) based on a <span class="bold-text">lateral flow assay (LFA).</span> Our device provides a <span class="bold-text">rapid, proactive, and point-of-care</span> approach to evaluating atherosclerosis risk, allowing <span class="bold-text">early treatment</span> and <span class="bold-text">potential reversal of disease.</span> This method will <span class="bold-text">significantly reduce cost</span> of current detection methods and provide a method of early atherosclerosis detection, <span class="bold-text">improving healthcare globally,</span> especially for <span class="bold-text">underserved communities.</span>

              An LFA is a <span class="bold-text">low-cost, convenient, and portable test</span> constructed to produce <span class="bold-text">results promptly</span> without a doctor’s visit.<sup>21</sup> Typically, LFAs are a diagnostic method for <span class="bold-text">pathogens, diseases,</span> and other lingering <span class="bold-text">health problems.</span> They detect biomarkers of diseases present in a <span class="bold-text">liquid sample</span> that is deposited on one end of the strip. The strip shows vertical lines after completion of the test, with one line indicating a negative test and two lines indicating a positive result. Getting results happens within a matter of <span class="bold-text">five to thirty minutes,</span> and LFAs can be rapidly produced for <span class="bold-text">widespread accessibility.</span> More about our specific design is available on our <a href="{{ url_for('pages', page='design') }}">design page</a>.

                <h4>OxLDL as a Biomarker</h4>
                <p>
                  Our test uses <span class="bold-text">antibodies</span> to detect <span class="bold-text">oxLDL</span> in a <span class="bold-text">blood sample.</span> OxLDL has been cited in the literature as a key factor in the <span class="bold-text">early development of atherosclerosis.</span><sup>22</sup> Every individual has a baseline concentration of oxLDL in their bloodstream, but in patients with atherosclerosis, <span class="bold-text">oxLDL levels are elevated.</span><sup>23</sup> It is a lipoprotein, which means it has a protein that is encompassed with a lipid shell.<sup>24</sup> The structure of oxLDL is not well-characterized<sup>25</sup>, which is why current assays utilizing oxLDL are not in development. In order to detect this biomarker, we designed <span class="bold-text">antibodies that recognize</span> known epitopes on <span class="bold-text">both</span> the <span class="bold-text">lipid portion</span> and <span class="bold-text">protein portion</span> of oxLDL to detect it from different angles. These regions will be used to bind to oxLDL for simplest detection. More about our specific design is available on our <a href="{{ url_for('pages', page='design') }}">design page</a>.

            <h4>Why Synthetic Biology?</h4>
            <div class="text-wrapper">
              <p>
                Synthetic biology plays a pertinent role in the development of our solution. It offers a tool set of techniques that detect early atherosclerosis, reduce cost, and allows for ethical considerations.
                <br>
                <br>
                Current diagnostic methods are costly and cater towards general cardiovascular disease, not atherosclerosis specifically. They also detect atherosclerosis during its late stages of development, at which point is largely irreversible. This is because they rely on the formation of the plaque that can be imaged. Synthetic biology, on the other hand, allows us to produce antibodies specific to early stage antigens that are present earlier than physical plaque formation.
                <br>
                <br>
                Furthermore, pharmaceutical antibody production requires inoculating animals with antigens. The animal is selected, bred, then antibodies are collected by isolating antibody-producing B-cells to create hybridoma cells.<sup>26</sup> It is also extremely time-consuming and costly. A synthetic biology approach circumvents animal interaction, making it cruelty-free. Additionally, it takes less time to produce antibodies in bacteria or yeast, thus lowering the overall cost of antibody production. This is an important consideration to make in terms of mass-scale production as the ultimate goal for this device is to mass produce LFAs for consumer use.  The specially genetically-engineered strain <span class="italic-text">E. coli</span> SHuffle circumvents these concerns.
              </p>

              <p>In addition to these benefits, synthetic biology also allows us to combine existing antibody sequences to construct new ones better optimized for production in our chassis and for specificity for our biomarker of interest. Through the open source community of synthetic biology and knowledge of the inner workings of antibodies, we have been able to design and produce these proteins.</p>

          <h2>Inspiration Behind Our Project</h2>
          <div class="text-wrapper">
            <p> 
              200,000 of the deaths caused by heart disease each year can be prevented with changes in health habits, such as diet, and help from proper healthcare<sup>27</sup>, but these changes are not accessible to everyone. As of 2021, 9.6% of the United States population did not have healthcare, which translates to 31.1 million people.<sup>28</sup> Atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease detection is possible in yearly medical check-ups, however, doctor’s visits for these individuals are not feasible options. The urgency of these issues is enhanced by the abundance of asymptomatic risk factors that go undetected until it is too late. 
              <br>
              <br>
	            Even those who have healthcare and are able to proceed with diagnostic testing are presented with problems surrounding cost. Numerous expensive tests with a high threshold for detection are required before a diagnosis is confidently provided. Healthcare is also becoming more complex as deductibles, copays, and coinsurance increase. Around 3.9 million families, making up 45% of those with atherosclerosis, reported a large difficulty in paying for these bills, and 1.6 million families were unable to do so.<sup>29</sup> Knowing that cardiovascular diseases are preventable yet affect so many people worldwide, we wanted to design a device was affordable and preventative.

            <h2>Future Directions</h2>
            <p>
              To further our project, our focus is to integrate these test results with healthcare providers by developing a helper app to quantify and log results, and develop a plan to improve health alongside doctors’ recommendations. Read more about our app design here.
              <br>
              <br>
              Another area of improvement is to increase antibody yields through optimizing <span class="italic-text">E. coli</span> SHuffle. This will enable more test strips to be produced at a faster rate, since more antibodies will be available for use. As a result, the cost of the strip will decrease, increasing its accessibility.
              <br>
              <br>
              While our test strip is predictive of atherosclerosis, we also want to improve its specificity for atherosclerosis by adding more antibodies that detect different biomarkers associated with atherosclerosis.
