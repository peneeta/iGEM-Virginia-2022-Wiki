  <h2>Inspiration Behind Our Project</h2>
  <p>
    Knowing that heart disease has a large impact on such a big percentage of the human population, as well as witnessing the recent discoveries of biomarkers and the molecular components of plaque buildup, we wanted to take the initiative towards lowering the CVD rate of mortality. The first step in doing this is earlier detection. </p>

  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>
    Atherosclerosis, an inflammatory disease characterized by plaque buildup in the inner arterial walls, is a common cardiovascular disease affecting millions in America and worldwide.  However current detection methods are costly, time-consuming, and often not used during medical visits unless individuals show signs of further cardiovascular complications. Here, we describe a method of early atherosclerosis detection centered around the detection of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), a biomarker in the bloodstream whose presence is associated with early to middle stages of atherosclerosis development. This synthetic biology approach provides individuals with a quick, accessible, and proactive approach to testing their likelihood of having atherosclerosis by using SHuffle E.coli to produce oxLDL antibodies and allowing the detection of oxLDL levels to be read from an easy-to-read test strip.  This method is projected to significantly reduce the cost of current detection methods and add a dimension to preexisting biomarker detection diagnostics.

    <h2>Some advice</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>We encourage you to put up a lot of information and content on your wiki, but we also encourage you to include summaries as much as possible. If you think of the sections in your project description as the sections in a publication, you should try to be concise, accurate, and unambiguous in your achievements. Your Project Description should include more information than your project abstract.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-lg-4">
    <h2>References</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>iGEM teams are encouraged to record references you use during the course of your research. They should be posted somewhere on your wiki so that judges and other visitors can see how you thought about your project and what works inspired you.</p>
