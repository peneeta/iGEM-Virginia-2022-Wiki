    <h2>Atherosclerosis</h2>
    <p>Atherosclerosis is a inflammatory disease which is developed due to the plaque build up within the arterial walls. Atherogenic stimuli such as hyperlipidemia appear to activate the inflammatory response by causing expression of mononuclear leukocyte recruiting mechanisms. New developments have showed that it is keen to understand how blood pressure leads to the delevopment of atherosclerosis as well. Modified LDL also has been shown to stimulate the production of monocyte colony stimulating factor. Though because of oxidized LDL in human atherosclerotic causing lesions this informs us that signals emanating from abnormal oxidative metabolism in the artery may be important in eliciting the inflammatory response.</p>

    <h4>Pathogenesis</h4>

    <h4>Problems with Current Diagnosis Methods</h4>

    <h2>Our Solution</h2>

    
  <h4>Inspiration Behind Our Project</h4>
  <p> Knowing that heart disease has a large impact on such a big percentage of the human population, as well as witnessing the recent discoveries of biomarkers and the molecular components of plaque buildup, we wanted to take the initiative towards lowering the CVD rate of mortality. The first step in doing this is earlier detection. </p>
