                        <p>
                            For our LFA, we decided to test for the presence of oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) because oxLDL is a biomarker of atherosclerosis found in the blood (The changing landscape of atherosclerosis | Nature). Then, if our test detected oxLDL, the patient would have evidence they are experiencing early atherosclerosis. 

                            Our strip contains one full-length antibody, an scFv fragment, and a VHH nanobody fragment Nanobody-based products as research and diagnostic tools | Elsevier Enhanced Reader, all which are produced in <span class="italic-text">E. coli</span> SHuffle. To detect oxLDL, we designed two primary antibodies. The labeled primary antibody binds to a protein component of oxLDL called MDA-modified apolipoprotein B (apoBMDA) Recombinant Human Antibodies Against Aldehyde-Modified Apolipoprotein B-100 Peptide Sequences Inhibit Atherosclerosis | Circulation (ahajournals.org), while the other primary antibody immobilized at the test line binds to oxidized phospholipids within oxLDL. The fact that these two primary antibodies bound to different epitopes helped ensure the antibodies did not interfere with the other’s binding site. Lastly, we designed a secondary antibody targeting the constant domain of the labeled primary antibody and used this on the control line to verify the test worked correctly.

                            An LFA requires the production of three different antibodies, which have complex structures containing disulfide bonds. Most bacteria, like <span class="italic-text">E. coli</span>, can only produce the disulfide bonds necessary for antibody production in their periplasm, because their cytoplasm is a reducing environment. This is not favorable for the formation of disulfide bonds. In order for the bonds to be formed, modification of the cytoplasm is vital for utilizing the cytoplasmic space to produce proteins. One group of scientists developed a strain of <span class="italic-text">E. coli</span> with an oxidizing cytoplasm that allows the formation of disulfide bonds, and this strain is SHuffle Efficient expression of full-length antibodies in the cytoplasm of engineered bacteria (nature.com). We determined through modeling that all of our antibodies and antibody fragments have disulfide bonds and the number of cysteines fall within the optimal range of our choice, so we chose the B-strain of <span class="italic-text">E. coli</span> SHuffle.

                            For each antibody, we designed a composite insert. Each insert was complete with a strong T7 promoter, an <span class="italic-text">E. coli</span> codon-optimized ribosomal binding site (RBS), the antibody coding sequence, and a terminator. Between each component, we included non-illegal restriction sites for modular design. This is so that other individuals or iGEM teams can swap out parts if needed to vary the rate of transcription or coding sequence. This is also very essential in transformation. 

                            <br>

                            We decided to biobrick a composite part for each antibody in order to use standard assembly. Having a single synthesized component only requires one step to assemble our plasmid. The backbone we used was pSB3K3, a low-copy number plasmid. Our goal was to synthesize functional antibodies, so we chose a low-copy plasmid to limit the metabolic burden on our cells, increasing the success of our antibodies being synthesized correctly.

                            We designed a secondary antibody to be immobilized on the control line. This antibody was a nanobody (VHH), a variable region heavy chain only antibody naturally found in camelids. The sequence we used was encoded for an anti-mouse VHH that binds to the constant domain on mouse IgG1 antibodies. This allowed the VHH to bind to the hybrid full-length primary antibody because it recognized the mouse constant domain within it.

                                SHuffle differs from standard <span class="italic-text">E. coli</span> in that it maintains a more oxidizing cytoplasm, which allows cells to correctly form disulfide bonds in proteins, which enables researchers to overexpress correctly folded proteins. 
                                Several major genetic modifications result in this modified cytoplasm. Two genes coding for cytoplasmic reductases, specifically thioredoxin reductase (trxB) and glutathione reductase (gor), are knocked out from the <span class="italic-text">E. coli</span> genome. While this leads to a less reducing and therefore more oxidizing cytoplasm, these two mutations on their own are lethal to the <span class="italic-text">E. coli</span>. This is due to a lack of reductases recycling other essential enzymes into their reduced state. So, another mutation called AhpC* is introduced into the genome, modifying 2-Cys alkyl hydroperoxide reductase. This mutation returns reducing power to an enzyme called glutaredoxin 1 (Grx1) and makes the previously described double knock out non-lethal to <span class="italic-text">E. coli</span>. In the oxidizing environment, thioredoxin enzymes including thioredoxin 1 (Trx1) are able to form disulfide bonds between cysteine residues of proteins. However, these thioredoxins form disulfide bonds indiscriminately between any two cysteine residues, meaning that the protein could be misfolded at this stage. So, researchers overexpress an enzyme called disulfide bond isomerase c (DsbC), which is naturally found in the periplasm of <span class="italic-text">E. coli</span>. This enzyme moves, or shuffles, mis-formed disulfide bonds to the correct conformations which finally results in correctly folded proteins in the cytoplasm.
