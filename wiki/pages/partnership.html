            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>In meeting with other iGEM teams for a collaboration or partnership, we found Team IISER Pune II. We realized we shared many common goals of our project in our first meeting, since we were both focused on creating antibodies and antibody fragments to bind to a particular biomarker. Throughout this partnership, we were able to gain some much-needed information about our chassis, E. coli SHuffle. We also showed them how to use resources such as ROSIE for protein modeling. Keep reading to learn more about our partnership.</p>
