      <h2>Communication is Key</h2>
      <p>
        Our approach to creating a product included vast prior research and expertise before we finalized our goal. This stems from our teamâ€™s belief that a solution cannot be made first before the problem is found, but rather a problem is known and a solution works within its conditions. Because we wanted to tackle the problem of rising cardiovascular diseases, we needed to make sure our solution would be implemented from the root cause of this problem, and not simply mitigate the effects. This is why our team has identified certain core values to integrate into all parts of our project. Let's explore the values we have chosen and how we incorporated them!
