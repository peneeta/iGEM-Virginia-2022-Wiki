        <h2>Communication is Key</h2>
        <p>Our approach to designing AtheroSHuffle included <span class="bold-text">vast prior research and expertise</span> before we finalized our goal. This stems from our team’s belief that a solution cannot be made first before the problem is found, but rather the solution works within an existing problem’s conditions. Because we wanted to tackle the problem of rising cardiovascular diseases, we needed to make sure our solution would be implemented from the <span class="bold-text">root cause of this problem,</span> and not simply mitigate the effects. This is why our team has identified certain core values to integrate into all parts of our project and a mission statement to communicate these goals.</p>

        <h2>Creating a Mission Statement</h2>
        <div class="text-wrapper">
          <h4>"AtheroSHuffle represents a collaboration between science and society…"</h4>
          <p>We talked to experts in the field, major stakeholders <span class="italic-text">(include the link to the major stakeholders part of page)</span>, the general public, and other iGEM teams to design a device that meets the needs of our target audience of everyday consumers by prioritizing accuracy as well as convenience. In addition to our device, we recognize that in order to create a lasting change in cardiovascular health, we need to raise awareness about the seriousness of this issue in the world today. Hence, we conducted efforts geared towards education about atherosclerosis, cardiovascular health, and synthetic biology to the general public of all ages.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-wrapper">
          <h4>…to proactively combat the complications of cardiovascular health"</h4>
          <p>It is not enough to detect cardiovascular disease once it has done irreversible damage. Rather it is important that we detect it while there is still time to reverse or slow the condition. This is the purpose of our device, AtheroSHuffle. Cardiovascular health encompasses a complex biological system reliant on many factors. There are a wide variety of symptoms and the disease impacts many parts of the body. Proactive measures allow users the opportunity to prevent further complications and ensure the best quality of life.</p>

          <h4>Integrity</h4>
          <p>We’ve worked hard throughout the design process of AtheroSHuffle to keep the needs of our users in mind and to ensure users are given honest and accurate results regarding their cardiovascular health.  We designed an app to analyze the results of an individual’s blood sample test and provide honest feedback and health recommendations.  We also worked with medical professionals as well as a clinical dietitian for heart and vascular patients to make sure we are basing our design off of honest and up-to-date information.</p>

          <h4>Novel</h4>
          <p>Our team spent the summer developing an innovative atherosclerosis diagnosis test focusing specifically on an individual’s oxLDL blood levels. Through conversations with healthcare experts and medical experts, we learned of the value of detecting biomarkers associated with atherosclerosis besides biomarkers, like C-reactive protein (CRP), that are already being tested in order to confirm the accuracy of diagnoses.  The novelty of our research arises from the antibodies we’ve designed specific to the oxLDL biomarker on our lateral flow assay test strip.</p>

          <h4>Teamwork</h4>
          <p>
            Teamwork comes when each member feels they are supported and their voice matters. Our team strives to maintain a challenging, yet cooperative atmosphere. Each team member has a role and when everyone does their part, we are able to create a system of checks and balances to create a trusting device that encourages general consumers to contemplate their cardiovascular health. We believe work can be play, which allows us to invest as much as we can give. No matter a short or long work day, we always had smiles on our face because we recognized the importance of the impact our project would have on society. This was only possible through the supportive environment we created as a team.

          <h4>Environment</h4>
          <p>With the rising use in single-use plastics and medical waste, our team wanted to lessen our impact on the environment. Although our current test strip has been prototyped in plastic, we have researched and planned to implement biodegradable materials for the cassette of our test strip. In addition, our LFA optimization works to include the minimal amount of materials and antibodies needed to still provide reliable results. Future projects would include creating a device similar to a diabetes digital reader that allows this test to be reusable. This project, however, can only be done once the research done in our current research is analyzed.</p>

          <h4>Global Engagement</h4>
          <p>
            Heart disease is the leading cause of death around the world. While it is the easiest to create a functional device using the resources nearby, we cannot address the global problem without acknowledging the unique challenges and factors that contribute to heart disease around different parts of the world. To learn about other perspectives, we discussed with different iGEM teams from around the world  (IISER Pune 2, Lithuania, URochester, Bio-Brussels etc.), and having these non-domestic collaborations allowed us to learn from different cultural standpoints. 
            <br>
            In addition, we partnered up with the IISER Pune 2 team to create a blog that would reach high school students around the world. We aim to encourage students to harbor an interest in STEM through our blog from a global perspective.

          <h4>Responsiveness</h4>
          <p>
            We maintained an open dialogue with experts in the field and affected stakeholders throughout our AtheroSHuffle development process.  Through conversation, we learned what individuals in the cardiovascular field felt needed to be emphasized in our research efforts.  For example, after meeting with a representative from Tury Health, we understood the importance of not only knowing atherosclerosis and information specific to our project, but also the importance of expanding our efforts and understanding cardiovascular health as a whole.  This feedback shaped the conversations we had during team meetings, and specifically integrated human practices and outreach meetings, as we adjusted our research efforts to cover a greater scope of heart health.

          <h4>Accessibility</h4>
          <p>With accessibility at the forefront of our design, we decided to create a test strip due to its relative ease of use and affordability. With the COVID pandemic, people became accustomed to using test strips to monitor their health. It also drastically increased the market for lateral flow assays and test strips, which advantageously refined the methods of production. While we recognize that our device will not be in mass production soon, we have designed a device that is affordable and accessible to all.   
            In addition, we have incorporated small changes such as changing the typical test strip color from red to black, to create a sharper contrast and including read-aloud features on our app for those who may have visual difficulties.
            Our IHP efforts also led us to the decision to create educational tools to raise awareness of the disease. We recognize that many people are unaware of atherosclerosis and therefore, as many experts pointed out, accessibility is first achieved through education of the topic.

          <h4>Transparency</h4>
          <p>
            From the start of our project to the end, we wanted to keep the commitment to remain transparent and be an open source platform. Our wiki details our weekly progress in wet lab and all of our findings are well documented. We are eager to share our findings as well as information regarding future projects that could strengthen our design with iGEM and the research community as a whole in hopes that our work could aid in the efforts toward improving atherosclerosis diagnosis.  We’ve also kept an open dialogue with medical and biosafety professionals to ensure our design provides a safe and effective product for users to benefit from.
            <br>
            In terms of our transparency with users, we recognize the limitations of our design and stress that our device is a screening device for use in conjunction with traditional diagnostic methods. When a positive result is received, we encourage users to speak with medical experts to share their concerns.

          <h4>Ethics</h4>
          <p>As a team, we all agreed that ethics was a priority in the design of the project and therefore, we started off with the question: Is synthetic biology a viable answer to the issue at hand? Many people are skeptical of synthetic biology as a solution. We met with many experts to answer this question and ultimately, the response was the same: The increasing issue of socioeconomic disparity, accessibility, and high risk of cardiovascular disease requires the use of synthetic biology to detect atherosclerosis in a proactive manner. With this reassurance, we began to design our device. This led to the decision of using E. Coli SHuffle as a vessel to create our antibodies. There are many ethical implications with traditional methods of antibody production that utilize animal inoculation. Therefore, we employed these engineered E. Coli to create our antibodies in an ethical manner.</p>

          <h2>Standing on the Shoulders of Giants</h2>
          <p>As a student-led research team, knowledge of the area in which we are researching is crucial. Many of us come from intellectual backgrounds rooted in STEM, so while these concepts of genetics, engineering, diagnostics, mathematical modeling, and biology are not new to us, much help is needed for us to properly execute and better inform our project design. As students at a university renowned for research, we have endless resources and experts in applicable fields very close by. We have taken advantage of the connections we have with our PI, Dr. Keith Kozminski, and other UVA faculty members, as well as the ability to grow connections with other experts, and intend to continue this practice throughout the aftermath of AtheroSHuffle. It is through these connections with those who have dedicated their career to being just as curious as the community of iGEM, that we are able to go into this project not only with ambition to detect early signs of arterial plaque build-up, but with the tools to do so.</p>
