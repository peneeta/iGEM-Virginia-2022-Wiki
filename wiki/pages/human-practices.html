        <h2>Communication is Key</h2>
        <p>
          Our approach to designing AtheroSHuffle included vast prior research and expertise before we finalized our goal. This stems from our team’s belief that a solution cannot be made first before the problem is found, but rather the solution works within an existing problem’s conditions. Because we wanted to tackle the problem of rising cardiovascular diseases, we needed to make sure our solution would be implemented from the root cause of this problem, and not simply mitigate the effects. This is why our team has identified certain core values to integrate into all parts of our project and a mission statement to communicate these goals.

      <h2>Creating a Mission Statement</h2>
      <div class="text-wrapper">
        <h4>"AtheroSHuffle represents a collaboration between science and society…"</h4>
        <p>We talked to experts in the field, major stakeholders <span class="italic-text">(include the link to the major stakeholders part of page)</span>, the general public, and other iGEM teams to design a device that meets the needs of our target audience of everyday consumers by prioritizing accuracy as well as convenience. In addition to our device, we recognize that in order to create a lasting change in cardiovascular health, we need to raise awareness about the seriousness of this issue in the world today. Hence, we conducted efforts geared towards education about atherosclerosis, cardiovascular health, and synthetic biology to the general public of all ages.</p>

      <div class="text-wrapper">
        <h4>…to proactively combat the complications of cardiovascular health"</h4>
        <p>It is not enough to detect cardiovascular disease once it has done irreversible damage. Rather it is important that we detect it while there is still time to reverse or slow the condition. This is the purpose of our device, AtheroSHuffle. Cardiovascular health encompasses a complex biological system reliant on many factors. There are a wide variety of symptoms and the disease impacts many parts of the body. Proactive measures allow users the opportunity to prevent further complications and ensure the best quality of life.</p>

        <h4>Integrity</h4>
        <p>We’ve worked hard throughout the design process of AtheroSHuffle to keep the needs of our users in mind and to ensure users are given honest and accurate results regarding their cardiovascular health.  We designed an app to analyze the results of an individual’s blood sample test and provide honest feedback and health recommendations.  We also worked with medical professionals as well as a clinical dietitian for heart and vascular patients to make sure we are basing our design off of honest and up-to-date information.</p>

        <h4>Novel</h4>
        <p>Our team spent the summer developing an innovative atherosclerosis diagnosis test focusing specifically on an individual’s oxLDL blood levels. Through conversations with healthcare experts and medical experts, we learned of the value of detecting biomarkers associated with atherosclerosis besides biomarkers, like C-reactive protein (CRP), that are already being tested in order to confirm the accuracy of diagnoses.  The novelty of our research arises from the antibodies we’ve designed specific to the oxLDL biomarker on our lateral flow assay test strip.</p>

        <h4>Teamwork</h4>
        <p>
          Teamwork comes when each member feels they are supported and their voice matters. Our team strives to maintain a challenging, yet cooperative atmosphere. We believe work can be play, which allows us to invest as much as we can give. Some of the best moments happened when we knew we had to get certain lab protocols accomplished during that day, and the whole team was in the lab at 10:30 pm listening to motivational music while crunching numbers for the perfect dilution. From our sleep-deprived state paired with 100 bpm pace and focus, we would all one-by-one add a small snippet of Spongebob references on the chalkboard. At the end of the night, our ligated bacteria was completed alongside a masterpiece of Spongebob memes. Whether everyone was working on the same aspect of the project or not, the supportive environment we have built for ourselves allows us to enter a positive feedback loop where each person’s motivation is only contagious. 
          <br>
          Outside of our team, we strive to find people who may have opposing views on our solution of the project, because we are willing to change the trajectory of our project. This includes meeting with numerous scientists and doctors, because we realize that challenging our thoughts and getting diverse perspectives on this project helps us overcome issues we overlooked as a team.
