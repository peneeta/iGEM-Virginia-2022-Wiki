        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>AtheroSHuffle is not the work of one person, but a whole team endeavor including our team members, our instructor, and our sponsors. Our team members each filled their own roles and contributed to an incredible team dynamic which allowed us to persevere in the toughest of times. Our instructor Dr. Kozminski taught us what we needed, guided us through the process of iGEM, and helped to secure the funds needed to make our project possible. Finally, our sponsors are the source of funds integral to the success of our project, and very little would have been possible without them. We would like to thank each and every one of the names listed below for making the 2022 Virginia iGEM AtheroSHuffle project possible. </p>
