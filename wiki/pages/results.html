            <h2>Cloning</h2>
            <p>We cloned our inserts into the pSB3K3 vector using traditional restriction cloning. We separately digested pSB3K3+mRFP and the inserts with SpeI and EcoRI and ligated the digest products together in a way that excised mRFP from the final product. We then extracted and analyzed plasmid DNA from six resulting white (mRFP-lacking) transformant colonies. We also analyzed the DNA from one pink (mRFP-containing) transformant colony. We then verified the successful creation of the plasmid devices through restriction mapping and sequencing. In the below gel images, only those lanes with red asterisks will be discussed.</p>

The white McPC603 colony highlighted in Figure 1 (Lane 5) matched the virtual digest when cut with the same restriction enzymes. Note that although the 0.4 kb band did not appear on the gel, this was expected as fragments shorter than 0.5 kb do not show well on this percentage of gel. The uncut colony displays a single band occurring lower on the gel than the linearized plasmid, which is expected for an uncut plasmid and indicates the plasmid preparation occurred successfully. The enzyme cutter controls we ran on pSB3K3+mRFP in lanes 7, 8, and 9 also showed expected bands.</p>

The uncut IK17 plasmid lane showed one band below the molecular weight predicted for the plasmid if the plasmid were linearized, while the cut IK17 plasmid showed bands at 2.2 kb and 1 kb as predicted (the 0.4 kb band was not expected to appear on the gel). However, the cutter controls in lanes 8, 9, and 10 showed bands at much higher molecular weights than predicted, indicating potential incomplete digesting activity by these enzymes.

              Note that the NEB Quickload Purple 1 kB Plus ladder used in the above gels has historically run faster through gels than the DNA samples for Team Virginia, leading all bands to appear slightly larger than they truly are. All band sizes reported were adjusted to normalize for this.

            <p>
              We blocked the membranes with 2 mg/ml BSA after dispensing antibodies at the test and control lines. We dispensed test and control antibodies with capillary tubes. oxLDL concentrations of 0 and 1.6 mg/dL were mixed with the gold nanoparticle complexes and the solutions were dispensed on the end of the nitrocellulose membrane.
              <br>
              <br>
              Shortly before the assay was conducted, the membranes were pretreated in one of three ways: left dry, pre-wetted in chase buffer (20 mM TBS with 0.05% Tween 20 at pH 7.4), or left dry but being washed with a drop of chase buffer once the labeled antibody and oxLDL mixture was applied. As shown in Figure 7, the blocking was successful and the gold nanoparticle complexes flowed down the test strip away from their application site. The complexes did not flow all the way down the dry membranes. The pre-wetted membranes became very fragile and sustained damage simply from being removed from the chase buffer container in which they were dipped. The dry membrane followed by chase buffer, however, allowed the gold nanoparticle complexes to flow down the entire length of the membranes without jeopardizing the integrity of the membrane.
