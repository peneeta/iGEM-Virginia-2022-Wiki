          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>Breaking down the barriers in science for people of different backgrounds is of utmost importance to our diverse team. We aimed to make our project accessible, representative, easy to use, and inclusive in all aspects.  To make our device accessible for people of varying socioeconomic background, we designed an inexpensive method of antibody production to ensure mass production at a low cost. Lateral flow assays are..

Our device is also disability-friendly. The results on the strip are a high contrast color to make it easier to see. Our wiki is also made with high contrast colors and a font type and size that is easy to read. For our app, there will be a read-aloud feature that verbalizes the test results and the app features out loud. 

In addition, inclusivity was a key stone to our IHP efforts. Our podcast featured researchers and doctors of underrepresented communities in the US, and the majority are women. We also partnered with an international team for the blog and podcast to bring the global synthetic biology community together. </p>
