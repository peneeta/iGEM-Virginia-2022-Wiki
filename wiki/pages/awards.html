                        <p>
                            Our team of 12 members contributed in meaningful, diverse ways. Our team members conceived the project idea, performed experiments, interpreted and analyzed data, created models, reached out to stakeholders and experts in the field, and prepared the wiki and presentation, the details of which are all outlined on our wiki. Individual attributions are also included on our wiki. 
                            Our mentor, Dr. Keith Kozminski, supported us during this project and advised us on how to best proceed whenever we ran into issues. Ms. Kay Christopher assisted with acquiring lab equipment and reagents. Team iGEM PUNE II and URochester helped provide insightful troubleshooting and outreach assistance. Collin Marino, team captain from Virginia 2021 iGEM team, assisted us with BioBricking; Eurofins USA provided gene sequencing service; Ieva Lingyte, Dr. Bindu Kalesan, and Dr. Norbert Leitinger gave advice on lateral flow assay design, identifying the gaps in our knowledge of cardiovascular diseases, and background on our biomarker, respectively.

                        <h4>Project Description</h4>
                        <p>We chose this project because cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United States and worldwide, and atherosclerosis is one of the most prominent contributors to cardiovascular disease. This issue is exacerbated by the high cost of health services in the US. Atherosclerotic diagnosis and testing are costly and inaccessible, especially to those uninsured. Additionally, early detection of atherosclerosis is rare and current methods usually detect the disease when it has entered its later stages. The later stages at which atherosclerosis is currently detected are often too severe for the reversal of the disease. However, early detection would allow patients to seek out medical treatment, change their lifestyles before their symptoms become severe or lethal, and have the potential of reversing the disease. We were inspired to give people a chance to proactively monitor their health and the opportunity to change their lives. Therefore, we set to work on an affordable and accessible form of early diagnosis â€“ AtheroSHuffle.</p>
